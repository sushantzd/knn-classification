# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification Project

## Project Overview

This project implements **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** classification on a dataset prepared for classification. The KNN algorithm is a simple, yet powerful, machine learning technique that classifies data points based on the labels of their nearest neighbors.

## Key Features

- **Dataset**:
  - A dataset prepared for classification was used to apply the KNN algorithm.
  - Features were used to predict the class label of each data point.

- **Modeling**:
  - The **KNN algorithm** was used for classification. This algorithm finds the K nearest data points and assigns the most common class label among them.

- **Evaluation**:
  - Model performance was evaluated using accuracy and other relevant classification metrics such as confusion matrix.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following libraries:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
